# Timed Quiz

## Description
This project was designed to be a short quiz that was timed. The questions and correct answers are set, so they don't change for each time the test is taken. 

A timer starts at the beginning of the test with 60 seconds that counts down over the duration of the test

For each correct answer, 20 points are given, and for each incorrect answer, 10 seconds are removed from the timer.

After the questions are all navigated through, or the timer expires, the user is prompted to enter their initials to be entered onto the scoreboard.

On the scoreboard the user can see their initials and score, and clear the board.


- What did you learn?

I probably took a lazy/easy way out about the different questions and registering correct/incorrect answers, but it works. I could have iterated over an object containing questions and their respective answers.

The bigger things that I really learned on this project was a lot about forms, and how I don't know how they work really, and I got a better understanding on jQuery syntax.
